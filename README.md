#  Default Prediction System using XGBoost

---

## Summary
Traditional credit scoring models (like FICO) often rely heavily on static history, potentially excluding "credit invisible" applicants who are financially stable, while approving prime borrowers who are actually over-leveraged.

This project analyzes over **2.2 million loan applications** (Lending Club, 2007–2018) to build a machine learning framework capable of predicting the **Probability of Default (PoD)**. By engineering features that measure borrower "capacity" and "intent" rather than just history, the final **XGBoost model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.74**, offering a robust alternative to traditional underwriting.

## Key Results & Impact
*   **Model Performance:** 0.744 AUC (XGBoost), outperforming the Random Forest baseline.
*   **Precision (Non-Default):** 0.94 — The model is highly reliable when approving loans.
*   **Risk Identification:** Successfully flagged **70%** of actual defaults in the holdout test set.
*   **Business Insight:** Identified that borrowers with a **Payment-to-Income (PTI) ratio > 15%** carry significantly higher risk, regardless of income level.

##  Feature Engineering 
To prevent data leakage and improve predictive power, I moved beyond raw bureau data and engineered synthesized financial metrics:

| Feature | Logic | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payment-to-Income (PTI)** | `(Installment / Monthly Income)` | Measures monthly affordability stress. |
| **Credit Utilization Efficiency** | `(Revol Bal / Util Rate)` | Detects reliance on revolving credit for liquidity. |
| **Delinquency Flag** | Binary composite of liens/bankruptcies | Captures historical behavioral patterns. |
| **Employment Stability** | Boolean (`Emp Length > 2 years`) | Proxy for income continuity and job security. |

## Visual Analysis
### 1. Risk Drivers
*Exploratory analysis revealing the sharp divergence in PTI and Utilization between compliant borrowers and defaulters.*

*(Note: Defaulters use 55% of available credit on average, compared to 49% for good borrowers.)*

### 2. Feature Importance
*The top factors driving the XGBoost decision logic.*

## Model Architecture
*   **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classifier (Gradient Boosting).
*   **Handling Imbalance:** The dataset had an 11.9% default rate. I used `scale_pos_weight` and stratified splitting to manage class imbalance.
*   **Preprocessing Strategy:**
    *   **Temporal Split:** Features were filtered to include *only* data available at the moment of application to prevent data leakage.
    *   **Target Mapping:** 'Charged Off' and 'Default' mapped to `1`; 'Fully Paid' and 'Current' mapped to `0`.
